<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

As of 2023, the <cite>[US Bureau of Labor Statistics][1]</cite> data shows the annual inflation is currently more than double the average prior to 2021.  <cite>[Forberg 2022][2]</cite> points out that one-third of the food that families buy every year makes it way into the garbage.  Now is not the time to be wasting food with the uncertainties of the job market and rising food prices.  

Have you found yourself accidentally buying extra perishables and now forcing you to overcook.  Are you generally using a note app on your phone to track your grocery list?  Need something that can do a little more like help track when a favorite pantry item is getting low.  My Pantry is convenient as your notepad that just does a little more.  That "little more" will help reduce your food waste and save you money at the grocery.  With an easy to use interface, you can track your favorite pantry items and recipes all in one site - no app downloads necessary.
